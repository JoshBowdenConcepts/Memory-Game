# Memory-Game
This is the second project in the Grow with Google Scholarship Program. I have created a memory game that relies on flipping and maching cards. I built this application using Gulp so if you would like it to run automatically then you will need to clone the git repo

``` git clone https://github.com/PixelPerfectDev/Memory-Game.git ```

then run

``` yarn install ```

from there you can start the server and compile the files with

``` yarn gulp ```

If you would like to do it without installing the package dependencies then you can run the index file in the Final Dist folder.

Here is a list of all packages that I used or worked with for development:
"gulp": "^3.9.1",
"gulp-clean": "^0.4.0",
"gulp-clean-css": "^3.9.4",
